-- Question:
-- Jack Frost wants to review all the cocoa breaks he actually took — including the cocoa type and the location he drank it in. How would you combine the necessary tables to show each logged break with its matching cocoa details and location?

-- Table Schema:
-- Table: cocoa_logs
--   log_id: INT
--   break_id: INT
--   cocoa_id: INT
--
-- Table: break_schedule
--   break_id: INT
--   location_id: INT
--
-- Table: cocoa_types
--   cocoa_id: INT
--   cocoa_name: VARCHAR
--
-- Table: locations
--   location_id: INT
--   location_name: VARCHAR
--

-- My Solution:

SELECT bs.break_id, cocoa_name, location_name
FROM  break_schedule bs
LEFT JOIN cocoa_logs cl
ON bs.break_id=cl.break_id
LEFT JOIN cocoa_types ct
ON cl.cocoa_id=ct.cocoa_id
LEFT JOIN locations l
ON bs.location_id=l.location_id
WHERE cocoa_name IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY bs.break_id
